/*
    This class is a modification of the original BasicPosKalman and is a stripped down version without velocity tracking.
    It was my hope that this would help to eliminate some error by simplifying the Kalman filtering process.

    This class is supposed to use a Kalman filter to track position along with x and y velocity.
    If anyone reading this actually has experience with this, I realize this is probably a complete abhorration of
    a Kalman filter, and I'm sorry

    Might end up needing to make the fields and methods of this class static as I will only run one instance and the
    CPU load might be too much for the RIO's pathetic excuse for a processor
